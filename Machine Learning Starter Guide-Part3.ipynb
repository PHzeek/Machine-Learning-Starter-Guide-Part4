    "Problem-specific metric functions available in [`sklearn.metrics`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/api/sklearn.metrics.html). Similar to how the `scoring` parameter can be passed different scoring functions, Scikit-Learn implements these as stand alone functions.\n",

    "* **Macro avg** - Short for macro average, the average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Macro avg doesn't take class imbalance into effect. So if you do have class imbalance (more examples pf oen class than another), you should pay attention to this.\n",
    "* **Weigthed avg** - Short for weighted average, the weighted average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Weighted means each metric is calcualted with respect to how many samples there are in each class.\n",

    "We'll check out the following.\n",

    "1. **R^2 (pronounced r-squared) or coeffiecient of determination** - Compares your models predictions to the mean targets. Values can range from negative infinity (a very poor model) to 1. For example, if all your model does is predict the mean of the targets, its R^2 value would be 0. And if your model perfectly predicts a range of numbers it's R^2 values would be 1. Higher the better.\n",
    "2. **Mean absolute error (MAE)** - The average of the ***absolute*** differences between predictions and actual values. It gives you an idea of how wrong your predictions were. Lower is better\n",
    "3. **Mean squared error (MSE)** - The average ***squared*** differences between predictions and actual values. Squaring the errors removes negative errors. It also amplifies outliers (samples which have larger errors). Lower is better.\n",
